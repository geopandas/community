# GeoPandas Community Docs and Discussions

Welcome to the GeoPandas community, an open community around the GeoPandas
project and related packages that share the goal of making it easier to work
with geospatial (vector/tabular) data in Python.

This GitHub repository is meant for general community discussions, connecting, announcements, meeting planning, etc.  
This way, you can more easily subscribe to those discussions if you want to follow the GeoPandas community, without having to follow the higher-traffic issue trackers of the individual projects.

Please feel free to open general issues that can be of interest for the GeoPandas community in this repo!

On the other hand if you ..

- Have a usage question about one of the projects? Please see the [getting started documentation](https://geopandas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#get-in-touch) on where to ask questions.
- Encountered a bug? Please report those at the respective issue tracker (e.g. for `geopandas`: https://github.com/geopandas/geopandas/issues). 
- Want to contribute to one of the packages? Check the [contributing guide](https://geopandas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/contributing.html)!


As a community, we strive towards an open, welcoming and diverse community. Read more about it in the [Code of Conduct](https://geopandas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/code_of_conduct.html).
